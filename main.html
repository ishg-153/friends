        <p>'Friends' is one of the most loved sitcoms of all time. It had a pivotal role in bringing in a modern take on living life as adults. The show has been a role model for young generations from the time of its launch. It's quick, witty, relatable, and obviously funny. The show has its own arc but is just as enjoyable to watch any one episode on its own. This makes it even more reachable and compelling for people to keep watching it on repeat. </p>
        <p>Ross is a quirky nerd who is very whinny(and irritating). On the other hand, Joey takes the cake (quite literally) with his immature charm and sweeps us all off; until he opens his mouth. While Chandler's awkwardness, humourous nature make him the most loveable of all. He is often referred to as the most relatable one because he finds his family amongst his friends. Monica(Ross's little sister) is a motherly figure to everyone; she is a host, an extraordinary cook(and a <em>kook</em>), and did I mention she loves to clean? Phoebe is the most righteous of them all; though she might come across as weird at first, she is caring and will do anything for her friends. Rachel is the spoiled one. But once her friends helped her come into the real world: she fit right in. She has an incredible fashion sense, is spirited, and would definitely make it as an influencer today.<br><br>

When these six come together, we have the time of our life.</p>
